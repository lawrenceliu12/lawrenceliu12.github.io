                        I am Lawrence, an aspiring software engineer, but a junior in Stony Brook University. I'm a Computer Science major, a Peer Mentor, an Event Coordinator, and an idealist. I want to use my skills to build and improve upon concepts and applications. I'm always willing for new and challenging projects!
